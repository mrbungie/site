# context-mode — MANDATORY routing rules

You have context-mode MCP tools available. These rules are NOT optional — they protect your context window from flooding. A single unrouted command can dump 56 KB into context and waste the entire session.

## BLOCKED commands — do NOT attempt these

### curl / wget — BLOCKED
Any shell command containing `curl` or `wget` will be intercepted and blocked by the context-mode plugin. Do NOT retry.
Instead use:
- `context-mode_ctx_fetch_and_index(url, source)` to fetch and index web pages
- `context-mode_ctx_execute(language: "javascript", code: "const r = await fetch(...)")` to run HTTP calls in sandbox

### Inline HTTP — BLOCKED
Any shell command containing `fetch('http`, `requests.get(`, `requests.post(`, `http.get(`, or `http.request(` will be intercepted and blocked. Do NOT retry with shell.
Instead use:
- `context-mode_ctx_execute(language, code)` to run HTTP calls in sandbox — only stdout enters context

### Direct web fetching — BLOCKED
Do NOT use any direct URL fetching tool. Use the sandbox equivalent.
Instead use:
- `context-mode_ctx_fetch_and_index(url, source)` then `context-mode_ctx_search(queries)` to query the indexed content

## REDIRECTED tools — use sandbox equivalents

### Shell (>20 lines output)
Shell is ONLY for: `git`, `mkdir`, `rm`, `mv`, `cd`, `ls`, `npm install`, `pip install`, and other short-output commands.
For everything else, use:
- `context-mode_ctx_batch_execute(commands, queries)` — run multiple commands + search in ONE call
- `context-mode_ctx_execute(language: "shell", code: "...")` — run in sandbox, only stdout enters context

### File reading (for analysis)
If you are reading a file to **edit** it → reading is correct (edit needs content in context).
If you are reading to **analyze, explore, or summarize** → use `context-mode_ctx_execute_file(path, language, code)` instead. Only your printed summary enters context.

### grep / search (large results)
Search results can flood context. Use `context-mode_ctx_execute(language: "shell", code: "grep ...")` to run searches in sandbox. Only your printed summary enters context.

## Tool selection hierarchy

1. **GATHER**: `context-mode_ctx_batch_execute(commands, queries)` — Primary tool. Runs all commands, auto-indexes output, returns search results. ONE call replaces 30+ individual calls.
2. **FOLLOW-UP**: `context-mode_ctx_search(queries: ["q1", "q2", ...])` — Query indexed content. Pass ALL questions as array in ONE call.
3. **PROCESSING**: `context-mode_ctx_execute(language, code)` | `context-mode_ctx_execute_file(path, language, code)` — Sandbox execution. Only stdout enters context.
4. **WEB**: `context-mode_ctx_fetch_and_index(url, source)` then `context-mode_ctx_search(queries)` — Fetch, chunk, index, query. Raw HTML never enters context.
5. **INDEX**: `context-mode_ctx_index(content, source)` — Store content in FTS5 knowledge base for later search.

## Output constraints

- Keep responses under 500 words.
- Write artifacts (code, configs, PRDs) to FILES — never return them as inline text. Return only: file path + 1-line description.
- When indexing content, use descriptive source labels so others can `search(source: "label")` later.

## CSS Architecture Rules

- **Shared structural sub-elements** (viz headers, panels, labels, cards, badges used across components) → defined as BEM classes in `src/styles/global.css`
- **Component-specific styles** → `ComponentName.module.css` co-located with the component
- **Inline `className`** → only for truly one-off, non-reusable values (e.g. a single margin tweak). Never for colors, typography, layout patterns, or anything that repeats across components
- No hardcoded color/typography/spacing tokens in JSX — always via CSS class

## ctx commands

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `ctx stats` | Call the `stats` MCP tool and display the full output verbatim |
| `ctx doctor` | Call the `doctor` MCP tool, run the returned shell command, display as checklist |
| `ctx upgrade` | Call the `upgrade` MCP tool, run the returned shell command, display as checklist |

## Astro & Tailwind v4 Deployment Rules

- **CSS Modules & Hydration** → Never use `client:only="react"` for components that use CSS Modules and Tailwind v4. This prevents Astro's static build from "discovering" and linking the corresponding stylesheet in the HTML `<head>`.
- **Force CSS Extraction** → Use `client:load` (or `client:visible`) even for Three.js/browser-heavy components. This ensures the CSS is correctly extracted and linked during production builds.
- **SSR Safety** → Ensure components that use browser APIs (window, document) guard them with `useEffect` or `typeof window !== 'undefined'` checks so they don't crash under `client:load`.
- **Inlining avoidance** → If CSS stays missing in production despite using `client:load`, check if Astro is aggressively inlining critical CSS into the `<style>` tag but failing to reach the threshold for the component's module.
